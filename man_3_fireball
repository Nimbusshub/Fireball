.SH DESCRIPTION
Fireball is a multipurpose command line tool for offensive and defensive security. This powerful tool can scan for open ports, listen and establish connection between devices.
The tool is currently under development. The sniffer, which can sniff a network and capture traffics, and other functionalities will be added soon.

.SH PORT SCANNER:
Fireball Scanner probes host(s) in a network for open ports, determine what services \
are running on the open ports and lists the result with the services running on individual ports.
.SH
.IP SPECIFIERS:
The specification is prepend by '-'. By default 'scan [ip address]' with no specifier will result in all 65535 ports\
being probed for open connection.
.TP
.B -p
.R This specifies the port that need to be scanned. \fI'-'\fR between specified ports insinuates range of ports.\
\fI-p 1-3580\fR means port 1 to 3580 will be probed. \fI','\fR between ports with no spaces will be interpreted as individual ports to scan. \
\fI-p 134,452,53,4\fR means port 134, 452, 53 and 4 will be scanned.
.TP
.B -h
.R Display helpful information on how to use scan.
.PP
.SH LISTENER:
The listener can be used to establish connection between devices, listen on arbitrary ports and \
send packet between networks.
.SH
.IP SPECIFIERS
Using command 'listen' specifies that fireball should listen for connection. It allows for options to be passed which determine what it will be used for.
.TP
.B -l
.R To listen for connection and bind to it.
.TP
.B -e
.R Executes the file passed to it.
.TP
.B -t
.R IP address of the target.
.TP
.B -p
.R Port number to listen on or connect to.
.TP
.B -u
.R Destination of the file to append the received content.
.TP
.B -h
.R Display helpful information on how to use listen.
.PP
.SH NETWORK SNIFFER:
.R Fireball sniffer intercepts and log traffic on a netwrok. It captures each packet that flows across the network and analyses its content.
.SH
.IP "Under development"
