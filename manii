.SH NAME 
Fireball - A multipurpose command line tool for offensive and defensive security.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.PP 
.BI "Connection Listener"
listen -p [port number] [ip address]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Fireball is a multipurpose command line tool for offensive and defensive security. This powerful tool can scan for open ports, listen and establish connection between devices and sniff on a network and capture the packets.\
The tool is currently under development. Many functionalities will be added soon.

I populated the other parts with junk. Man page still in process.
.SH 
.IP FORMAT:
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. Format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters \ 
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specification (%) each of which results in fetching zero or more.
.SH
.IP SPECIFIERS:
Conversion specification is introduced by % and ends with a conversion specifier. Conversion specifiers specifies the type of conversion to be applied. \
In between there may be zero or more flags and an optional length modifier. The conversion specifiers of the _printf() function are:
.TP 
.B c
.R The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
.R The \fIconst char *\fR argument is a pointer to an array of characters , that converts the corresponding argument to a character string.
.TP
.B d, i
.R The \fIint\fR is converted to a signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B b
.R The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is converted to a binary.
.TP
.B o, u, x, X
.R The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is converted to unsigned octal \fBo\fR (base 8), unsigned decimal \fBu\fR (base 10), or unsigned hexadecimal \fBx\fR and \fBX\fR notation (base 16).\ 
The letters abcdef are used for \fBx\fR conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for \fBX\fR conversions.
.TP
.B % %%
.R If only the \fI%\fR character is written no argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is \fI%%\fR, that returns the actual sign if there in front.
.TP
.B S
.R The \fIconst char\fR argument is a pointer to an array of characters, that converts the corresponding argument to a character string, with non-printable characters \
(0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127).
.TP
.B p
.R The \fIvoid *\fR pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as if by %#x or %#lx).
.TP
.B r
.R The \fIconst char\fR prints the strings in reverse.
.TP
.B R
.R The \fIconst char\fR prints the rot13'ed string.
.SH
.IP FLAGS:
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
.TP
.B #
.R Prints number in hexadecimal, uppercase hexadecimal and octal where the first character of the output string is made zero.
.TP
.B +
.R A sign \fB+\fR or \fB-\fR will be placed before a number followed by a signed conversion.
.TP 
.B ' '
.R A \fI(space)\fR blank space should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.
.SH
.IP LENGTH-MODIFIER
The "integers conversion" stands for d, i, o, u, x or X.
.TP
.B l
.R (ell) A following integer conversion corresponds to a \fIlong\fR or \fIunsigned long\fR argument, or a following \fBn\fR conversion corresponds to a pointer to a \fIlong\fR ar\
gument or a following \fBc\fR conversion corresponds to an \fIwint_t\fR argument, or a following \fBs\fR conversion corresponds to a pointer to \fwchar_t\fR argument.
.B h
.R A following integer conversion corresponds to a \fshort\fR or \funsigned short char\fR argument,  or a following \fBn\fR conversion coresponds to a pointer to a \fshort\fR argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the number of all characters in the format string excluding the NULL byte used to terminate the loop.
.SH EXAMPLE
.R To print the strings of \fBWe did it!\fR and its length in decimal.

#include ''main.h''

int main(void)

{

	int length;

	_printf(''%s'', ''We did it!'');
	
	length = _printf(''We did it! contains %d characters'', length);

	return (0);

}
